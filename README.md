# World Weather Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to modify the PlanMyTrip app to:
1) include weather descriptions
2) accept and use input statments to filter data for weather preferences and identify travel destinations and nearby hotels
3) select 4 cities to create a travel itinerary
4) create a travel route connecting the 4 cities
5) create a marker layer map with the 4 cities

## Results
1) Weather descriptions is now being collected as shown here: [WeatherPy_Database.csv](https://github.com/lexyzhong/world-weather-analysis/blob/main/Weather_Database/WeatherPy_Database.csv)
2) The app can now accept and use input statements (e.g. min = 0, max = 100 in this test run) to filter for weather preferences and identify travel destinations and nearby hotels: [WeatherPy_vacation.csv](https://github.com/lexyzhong/world-weather-analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation.csv) ![WeatherPy_vacation_map.png](https://github.com/lexyzhong/world-weather-analysis/blob/main/Vacation_Search/WeatherPy_vacation_map.png)
